The vutton theme for Wordpress
==============================

I guess you can do about whatever you want with it according to the WTFPL
licence.

This template is between the work-in-progress state and the "Woo, I not exactly
looking for a fully working theme, just one that make my website look pretty
with the features I need"-state. Long story short, It does not follow
guidelines from wordpress (yes, they guys actually have guidelines, funny uh?).

Some parts are hard-coded, in French. But please fork if you want to, use the
stylesheet if you want to, it is located in `bootstrap/vutton.less`.

Howto?
======

Fork `twitter/bootstrap`, copy (and replace) the files from `vutton/bootstrap`
into `twitter/bootstrap/less`, compile, append the result (`bootstrap.css`)
in `styles.css`, you are mostly done, I guess.
